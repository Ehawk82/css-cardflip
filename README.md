# css-cardflip

going to learn this the right way.  
#Intro: 

we are going to start with the basic card flip and evolve it in to a game.

using: JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS.  
-className, sort, map.... those are the things. 

#goals:
One option to trying to morph map and sort in to this, is to make a new button that will shuffle the cards that are gone and redistribute them as new cards in the same spot>
-function that does a reshuffle, (but only for the cards that are not on the board ".nocard".)
-in that function scope, >after the shuffle<, set the cards back to ".card"

#notes: 
match 3(Math.random will not return an even game board, need to map and sort)
